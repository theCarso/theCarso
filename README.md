Hello! My name is Carson, and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. Here, you can see some of my recent works, which will mostly contain of projects from school and personal projects mainly involving Spigot plugins.

I currently am developing in a team known as MineCaveMC, which is a Minecraft server, using plugins coded in Java.

Thanks for visiting!
