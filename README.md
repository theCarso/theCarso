# Carson Miller // theCarso
Hello! My name is Carson, and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. Here, you can see some of my recent works, which will mostly contain of projects from school and personal projects mainly involving Spigot plugins.

I currently am developing in a team known as MineCave, which is a Minecraft server, using custom mods (plugins) coded in Java using the Spigot API.

Thanks for visiting!
